Each group has specific entry conditions and we haven’t listed them all. \nThe trial team check if you are suitable to join the trial and which group you might join. They can tell you more about this. \nThe group you join depends on a number of factors such as: \nif you have high risk or standard risk myeloma\nhow well your initial treatment works \nThe following bullet points summarise some of the main entry conditions. Talk to your doctor or the trial team if you are unsure about any of these. They will be able to advise you.\nWho can take part\nYou may be able to join this trial if all of the following apply. You:\nhave newly diagnosed myeloma  \nare suitable to have as stem cell transplant  \ncan swallow medication\nare well enough to be up for more than half a day but might not be able to work (performance status 0, 1 or 2)\nhave satisfactory blood test results \nare willing to use reliable contraception during the trial and for a period after if there is any chance you or your partner could become pregnant \nare at least 18 years old \nWho can’t take part\nCancer related\nYou cannot join this trial if any of these apply.
