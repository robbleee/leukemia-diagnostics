Your doctor will know about this. \nYou have had at least 1 and no more than 2 certain treatments for your B cell cancer. Your doctor will know which treatments these are and how many you have had.\nYou have an area of cancer the doctor can measure on a scan. The doctor checks the size of the cancer to see if you are suitable to take part.
