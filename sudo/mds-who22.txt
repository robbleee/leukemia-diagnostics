TBC: how do we initially determine between MDS and AML 


---------- who ----------

if any of these Biallelic TP53 mutation (true):
    2 x TP53 mutations  -> MDS with biallelic TP53 inactivation (WHO 2022)
    1 x TP53 mutation + del(17p) -> MDS with biallelic TP53 inactivation (WHO 2022)
    1 x TP53 mutation + LOH -> MDS with biallelic TP53 inactivation (WHO 2022)


TBC: does fibrotic take precidence?
else if blasts percentage:
    5-9% -> MDS with increased blasts 1 (WHO 2022)
    10-19% -> MDS with increased blasts 2 (WHO 2022)
    5-19% && fibrotic -> MDS, fibrotic (WHO 2022)  


else if any of these MDS-related mutations are true:
    SF3B1 -> MDS with low blasts and SF3B1 (WHO 2022)


else if MDS-related cytogenetics (true):
    del(5q) -> MDS with low blasts and isolated 5q- (WHO 2022)


else if hypoplasia -> MDS, hypoplastic (WHO 2022)


TBC: what is a dysplastic lineage?
else if Number of dysplastic lineages:
    =1 : MDS with low blasts (WHO 2022)
    >1 : MDS with low blasts (WHO 2022)


qualifiers (true/false):
    Previous cytotoxic therapy?
    [already derived classification], post cytotoxic therapy (WHO 2022)


    Predisposing germline variant?
    [already derived classification], associated with germline [insert predisposition] (WHO 2022)
