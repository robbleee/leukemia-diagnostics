# Clinical Trial Matching System Documentation

## Overview

The Haem.io Clinical Trial Matching System is an AI-powered platform that analyzes patient genetic profiles and clinical characteristics to identify relevant blood cancer clinical trials. The system provides intelligent, evidence-based trial recommendations to help connect patients with potentially life-saving treatment opportunities.

## Current Data Source

### Cancer Research UK (CRUK) Clinical Trials Database

The system currently utilizes blood cancer clinical trials from the Cancer Research UK website, specifically from their clinical trial finder platform at `https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/find-a-clinical-trial/`. 

**Current Database Characteristics:**
- **Size**: 38 curated blood cancer trials
- **Geographic Focus**: Primarily UK-based trials with some international studies
- **Quality**: High-quality, manually curated trials with comprehensive eligibility criteria
- **Coverage**: Includes trials for:
  - Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)
  - Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS)
  - Various lymphomas (B-cell, T-cell, Hodgkin's, Non-Hodgkin's)
  - Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL)
  - Multiple Myeloma
  - Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML)
  - Other blood cancer subtypes

**Data Structure:**
Each trial in the database contains:

## System Architecture

### 1. Patient Data Processing

#### Genetic/Molecular Profile Extraction
The system automatically extracts comprehensive genetic information from uploaded laboratory reports:

- **AML-Defining Genetic Abnormalities**
  - NPM1 mutations
  - FLT3 mutations (ITD and TKD)
  - CEBPA mutations

  - KMT2A rearrangements
  - TP53 mutations

- **MDS-Related Mutations**
  - SF3B1, SRSF2, U2AF1 (splicing factors)
  - ASXL1, EZH2 (epigenetic regulators)
  - TET2, DNMT3A, IDH1/2 (DNA methylation)
  - RUNX1, TP53 (transcription factors)

- **ELN2024 Risk Stratification Genes**
  - Favorable, intermediate, and adverse risk markers
  - Cytogenetic abnormalities
  - Molecular markers for prognosis

#### Clinical Information Collection
The system collects additional patient data through user input forms:

- **Demographics**: Age, gender
- **Performance Status**: ECOG performance score
- **Disease Status**: Newly diagnosed, relapsed, refractory, in remission
- **Treatment History**: Prior chemotherapy regimens, targeted therapies, transplants
- **Comorbidities**: HIV, hepatitis B/C, heart failure, active infections
- **Laboratory Values**: Blood counts, organ function markers
- **Reproductive Status**: Pregnancy, breastfeeding status

#### Data Formatting
The `format_patient_data_for_matching()` function creates a structured clinical profile that includes:

```
PATIENT CLINICAL PROFILE:
- Basic demographics and performance status
- Primary diagnosis (automatically determined from genetic classification)
- Disease status and treatment history
- Comprehensive genetic/molecular markers
- Laboratory values and comorbidities
- Original clinical report text
```

### 2. AI-Powered Matching Algorithm

#### OpenAI GPT-4 Integration
The system leverages OpenAI's GPT-4 model for intelligent trial matching:

- **Model**: GPT-4o with temperature 0.1 for consistent, conservative recommendations
- **Context**: Specialized prompt engineering for clinical oncology expertise
- **Processing**: Batch processing of 5 trials at a time for optimal performance
- **Concurrency**: Maximum 3 concurrent API requests with semaphore control

#### Matching Process
1. **Trial Filtering**: Only evaluates trials with "open" status
2. **Batch Processing**: Groups trials into batches of 5 for efficient API usage
3. **AI Analysis**: Each batch receives structured prompt containing:
   - Complete patient clinical profile
   - Detailed trial descriptions and eligibility criteria
   - Instructions for conservative, evidence-based assessment

4. **Structured Output**: AI returns JSON response with:
   - Relevance score (0-100 scale)
   - Detailed eligibility explanation
   - Specific matching factors
   - Potential exclusion factors
   - Recommendation level (recommend/consider/not_suitable)

#### Scoring and Prioritization
- **Highly Recommended** (Score ≥70): Strong evidence of eligibility
- **Consider** (Score 40-69): Potential eligibility with some uncertainty
- **Not Suitable** (Score <40): Clear exclusion factors or poor match

### 3. Enhanced Recommendations

For top-scoring trials (relevance score ≥60), the system generates detailed clinical recommendations including:

- **Clinical Rationale**: Why the trial suits the specific patient
- **Molecular Match**: How genetic profile aligns with trial requirements
- **Risk-Benefit Assessment**: Potential benefits versus risks
- **Practical Considerations**: Location, timing, and logistical factors
- **Next Steps**: Specific actions for patient and oncologist
- **Priority Classification**: High/medium/low based on overall assessment

### 4. User Interface and Results Display

#### Results Dashboard
- **Statistics Overview**: Count of highly recommended vs. consider trials
- **Priority Grouping**: Separates recommendations by confidence level
- **Expandable Details**: Comprehensive trial information with AI explanations
- **Debug Mode**: Transparent view of formatted patient data and matching logic
